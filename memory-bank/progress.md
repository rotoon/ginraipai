# Progress

## What works

- Project documentation (Memory Bank) initialized
- Core requirements, goals, and MVP scope defined
- Expo project (TypeScript) scaffolded in ginraipai-app
- Dripsy installed and working as the sole UI library
- App refactored to use only Dripsy components
- Codebase organized: components/, screens/, contexts/, utils/, types/
- Placeholder screens (Onboarding, Dashboard, Camera) and PrimaryButton component created
- Navigation set up for all screens
- Test screen removed, codebase is clean
- Onboarding flow fully implemented, animated, and visually polished
- Animated transitions, error messages, and progress indicator
- Visually distinct, stable-width navigation buttons
- All fields styled, accessible, and mobile-friendly

## What's left to build

- Continue building UI for dashboard, camera, and meal features
- Implement authentication, meal recognition, meal logging, dashboard, and UI components
- Technical setup: Expo, Supabase/Firebase, Dripsy, Google Vision API integration
- Polish, bug fixes, and feature enhancements

## Current Status

- Onboarding flow is complete and visually polished
- Dripsy is the official UI library, NativeBase removed, app refactored, codebase organized, test screen removed
- Ready to focus on other features, polish, or bug fixes

## Known Issues

- Animation direction bug: when going back then forward rapidly, the card animation direction may be incorrect (documented for future fix)
